# Interview Homework

## Instructions

* Download the solution.
* Look for the AmusementParkRepository class that has a URL to an API endpoint full of amusement park information.
* Use the web project (ASP.NET MVC) to create a web app with the following acceptance criteria:
  * The app will show a list of amusement parks, showing their location by city/state/country.
  * Each item in the list will be a link to a detail page.
  * The detail page will show the full details of the park.
  * Everything is responsive and mobile-friendly.
  * Optional bonus, if you have time: An embedded map that shows the location on the detail page.
* System requirements:
  * Use the included MVC project for the web project, but you're otherwise free to organize as you choose.
  * Use a dependency injection container in the web project (any is fine).
  * Use Bootstrap or Material Design for styling.
  * Unit test *something* in the solution. Surprise me.
  * Finished solution should be right-click-run ready.

## What I'm looking for

* How you compose a solution. Hint: Looking for something well-factored, as if this were the basis for something that will grow huge.
* Coding style and craftsmanship.
* Which approach you take... there is no right approach, whether it's a SPA or traditional Razor views, just want to see how you do it.
* Which client-side technologies you choose. Also no right answers, just want to see what you do.
* How you deal with ambiguity in a first-pass at a problem.

Have fun with this, but right-size the effort.
